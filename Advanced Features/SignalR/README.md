## Introduction

ASP.NET Core SignalR is an open-source library that simplifies adding real-time web functionality to apps. Real-time web functionality enables server-side code to push content to connected-clients as it happens in real-time. Furthermore, SignalR integrates seemlessly with ASP.NET framework.

SignalR uses WebSocket which enables a bi-directional communication between the browser and server.
